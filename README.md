# DnDCharacterApp

![logo](src/main/resources/com/nightbreeze/images/logo-DnDCharacterApp.jpg)

This project is an App you can run to create and manipulate your DnD characters.

It is done in Java with JavaFX for the visual interface.
The visual interface in made in SceneBuilder.

## Recommendations

I recommend that ou still have the books on other platforms (DnDBeyond, physical, etc.) as this app doesn't give book's information.

## Project status

### What will the app do ?

Currently, the following will be the implemented features:

- Creation of one character
- Health points with automatic manipulation (damage, temporary health points)
- Spell implementation (spell slots, spell lists)
- Death saves
- Ability checks (saving and basic throw, skills tests)
- Attack checks (attack and damage throw)
