# DnDCharacterApp

![logo](src/main/resources/com/nightbreeze/images/logo-DnDCharacterApp.jpg)

This project is an App you can run to create and manipulate your DnD5e characters.

The current name is a placeholder and the project will possibly be renamed later on.

It is done in Java with JavaFX for the visual interface.
The visual interface in made in SceneBuilder.

## Recommendations

I recommend that you still have the books on other platforms (DnDBeyond, physical, etc.) as this app doesn't give book's information.

## Project status

### What will the app do ?

Currently, the following will be the implemented features:

- Creation of one character
- Health points with automatic manipulation (damage, temporary health points)
- Spell implementation (spell slots, spell lists)
- Death saves
- Ability checks (saving and basic throw, skills tests)
- Attack checks (attack and damage throw)

### Currently working on

- Visual for the main page
- JSON files (species, weapons, classes, armors, tools, etc.)
- Creation of a character and storing into a JSON file (stored in `C:\Users\[user]\Documents\.DnDAppCharacters`)
